<p> I study immunodominance and the development of the immune repertoire. In other words, my research asks why and how our immune system comes to focus on certain parts of a given virus, while paying relatively litte attention to other perfectly good antigenic targets. I am particularly interested in how childhood immune imprinting shapes these biases in immune memory. Through this research, I hope to learn why the immune system is so bad at deploying broadly protective antibody responses, and whether vaccines can train the adaptive immune system to elicit broader cross-protection. In theory, broadly immune cross-protection should make it harder for viruses like influenza and HIV to adaptively escape immune memory, and to repeatedly or chronically infect a given individual. </p>

<p> I develop computational models to analyze data collected at multiple scales, and I'm broadly interested in understanding how the outcomes of microscopic, wihtin-host immune processes shape global epidemic outcomes.  </p>

<p> Currently, I am a McDonnell Foundation Postdoc working with Sarah Cobey and Patrick Wilson at the University of Chicago. Previously, I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from UCLA, supervised by Jamie Lloyd-Smith, and an AB in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University. </p>



<p> In an ideal world, broadly protective antibodies would be our immune system's first line of defense. Broadly protective immunity should protect against diverse strains of influenza, HIV and other multi-strain viruses, and could be particularlay difficult for these viruses to escape via adaptation. But unfortunately for us, broadly protective antibody responses rarely play a dominant role in defense against viral invaders. Instead, our immune system tends to deploy antibodies that only protect against a narrow slice of strain diversity. As a result, viruses like influenza and HIV can rapidly adapt to escape host immunity, and can chronically or repeatedly infect the same individual. </p>

<p> Narrow, easy-to-escape immunity also poses a major obstacle to vaccine development. The influenza vaccine requires frequent and costly updates to keep pace with antigenic evoltuion, and does not protect against swine or avian-origin viral variants. Scientists have struggled for decades to produce an HIV vaccine that provides broad cross-protection against all possible viral variants. </p> 

	I am completing a James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoc in a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/lloydsmith/">Lloyd-Smith Lab</a> in <a href = "https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/">UCLA's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.</a> </p>

<p> I use mathematical models to study how infectious diseases spread through human populations, and to identify signatures of pre-existing immunity. I develop and fit statistical models to large, epidemiological data sets to learn how new infectious diseases emerge into humans, and to identify factors that limit their spread.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:100px">My dissertation research focuses on the impacts of broadly protective influenza immunity in humans, but I am generally interested in research on how emerging infectious diseases gain the ability to spread through new populations, and in using mathematical models evaluate rational control startegies for infectious diseases.</p>

<h2 class = "research"> Most influenza immunity provides narrow protection </h2>
<p> As a result, humans can be repeatedly infected over a lifetime. Influenza viruses can perpetually evolve to outrun population immunity, and we must constantly update the seasonal influenza vaccine to keep pace with this antigenic drift. Furthermore, narrow immunity leaves most humans relatively unprotected against animal-origin influenza viruses, which can spill over into humans and cause severe, global pandemics.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Broader influenza immunity is possible </h2>
<p> Efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines aim to solve many of the problems of narrow influenza immunity by directing the immune response toward more conserved (invariant) parts of the virus. In theory, this could induce broad cross protection against the full diversity of known influenza viruses, thus avoiding the need for regular vaccine updates, and facilitating vaccine-driven protection against pandemic influenza viruses. My published dissertation work shows that broadly protective influenza immunity already acts strongly in human populations in certain epidemic contexts, and that this broadly protective immunity is predictably tied to a person's birth year.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Ongoing dissertation research </h2>
<p>  The remainder of my dissertation asks how broadly protective immune memory develops across childhood, and what promotes the strongest, broadly protective influenza immunity later in life. Other ongoing projects aim to identify the epidemiologial contexts in which we should or should not expect broadly protective immunity to be expressed against influenza, and to determine whether this kind of immunity prevents disease entirely, or merely reduces disease severity.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Postdoctoral plans </h2>
<p> As a postdoc, I plan to focus on the underlying immune dynamics of B cell selection, which determine whether broadly neutralizing antibodies are expressed against influenza, HIV and other viral pathogens. To support this work, I recently received a letter of intent to fund from the <a href = "https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/"> James S. McDonnell Foundation </a> and I am now seeking a host lab. </p>
