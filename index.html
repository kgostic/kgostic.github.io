<p> I am a <a href = "https://www.jsmf.org/programs/cs/"> McDonnell Foundation Postdoc </a> working with <a href=""> Sarah Cobey </a> and <a href=""> Patrick Wilson </a> at the University of Chicago. Previously, I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from UCLA, supervised by <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/lloydsmith/"> Jamie Lloyd-Smith</a>, and an AB in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University. </p>


<p> I build mathematical and computaional models to study how infectious diseases emerge and spread. </p>

<p> I spent much of 2020 working with the <a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/">Cobey lab</a> to analyze COVID-19 data in real time and to support decision making in Illinois. Previously, I contributed <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55570">research</a> showing that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/05564">airport traveler screening</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/health/amusement-parks-temperature-checks/index.html">fever screening</a> is fundamentally ineffective to slow or prevent the spread of emerging infectious diseases. I am interested in identifying more effective surveillance and screening approaches to prevent the next pandemic. </p>

<p> Another focus of my reserach is understanding how <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6313/722">early childhood influenza exposures</a> shape lifelong immune memory. We gain particularly strong, lifelong protection against influenza viruses on the same branch of the genetic tree as the viruses that circulated when we were children. But this strong memory may come at the expense of equally strong protection against influenza viruses encountered later in life. As a postdoc, I am working to understand how these birth year-specific biases in immune memory develop, and how they shape the birth year-specific effectiveness of influenza vaccination.</p>
