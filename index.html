<p> I study immunodominance and the development of the immune repertoire. In other words, my research asks why and how our immune system comes to focus on certain parts of a given virus, while paying relatively litte attention to other perfectly good antigenic targets. I am particularly interested in how childhood immune imprinting shapes these biases in immune memory. Through this research, I hope to learn why the immune system is so bad at deploying broadly protective antibody responses, and whether vaccines can train the adaptive immune system to elicit broader cross-protection. In theory, broadly immune cross-protection should make it harder for viruses like influenza and HIV to adaptively escape immune memory, and to repeatedly or chronically infect a given individual. </p>

<p> I develop computational models to analyze data collected at multiple scales, and I'm broadly interested in understanding how the outcomes of microscopic, wihtin-host immune processes shape global epidemic outcomes.  </p>

<p> Currently, I am a <a href = "https://www.jsmf.org/programs/cs/"> McDonnell Foundation Postdoc </a> working with <a href=""> Sarah Cobey </a> and <a href=""> Patrick Wilson </a> at the University of Chicago. Previously, I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from UCLA, supervised by <a href="https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/lloydsmith/"> Jamie Lloyd-Smith </a>, and an AB in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University. </p>
