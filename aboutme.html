<p> I am a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/lloydsmith/">Lloyd-Smith Lab</a> in <a href = "https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/">UCLA's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.</a> </p>

<p> I use mathematical models to study how infectious diseases spread through human populations, and to identify signatures of pre-existing immunity. I develop and fit statistical models to large, epidemiological data sets to learn how new infectious diseases emerge into humans, and to identify factors that limit their spread.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:100px">My dissertation research focuses on the impacts of broadly protective influenza immunity in humans, but I am generally interested in research on how emerging infectious diseases gain the ability to spread through new populations, and in using mathematical models evaluate rational control startegies for infectious diseases.</p>

<h2 class = "research"> Most influenza immunity provides narrow protection </h2>
<p> As a result, humans can be repeatedly infected over a lifetime. Influenza viruses can perpetually evolve to outrun population immunity, and we must constantly update the seasonal influenza vaccine to keep pace with this antigenic drift. Furthermore, narrow immunity leaves most humans relatively unprotected against animal-origin influenza viruses, which can spill over into humans and cause severe, global pandemics.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Broader influenza immunity is possible </h2>
<p> Efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines aim to solve many of the problems of narrow influenza immunity by directing the immune response toward more conserved (invariant) parts of the virus. In theory, this could induce broad cross protection against the full diversity of known influenza viruses, thus avoiding the need for regular vaccine updates, and facilitating vaccine-driven protection against pandemic influenza viruses. My published dissertation work shows that broadly protective influenza immunity already acts strongly in human populations in certain epidemic contexts, and that this broadly protective immunity is predictably tied to a person's birth year.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Ongoing dissertation research </h2>
<p>  The remainder of my dissertation asks how broadly protective immune memory develops across childhood, and what promotes the strongest, broadly protective influenza immunity later in life. Other ongoing projects aim to identify the epidemiologial contexts in which we should or should not expect broadly protective immunity to be expressed against influenza, and to determine whether this kind of immunity prevents disease entirely, or merely reduces disease severity.  </p>

<h2 class = "research"> Postdoctoral plans </h2>
<p> As a postdoc, I plan to focus on the underlying immune dynamics of B cell selection, which determine whether broadly neutralizing antibodies are expressed against influenza, HIV and other viral pathogens. To support this work, I recently received a letter of intent to fund from the <a href = "https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/"> James S. McDonnell Foundation </a> and I am now seeking a host lab. </p>
